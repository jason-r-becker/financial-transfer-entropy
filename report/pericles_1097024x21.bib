abstract = {Abstract We present a modification of the spring-embedder model of Eades [Congressus Numerantium, 42, 149â€“160, (1984)] for drawing undirected graphs with straight edges. Our heuristic strives for uniform edge lengths, and we develop it in analogy to forces in natural systems, for a simple, elegant, conceptually-intuitive, and efficient algorithm.},,
